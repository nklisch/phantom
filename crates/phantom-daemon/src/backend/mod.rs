//! Terminal backend abstraction.
//!
//! Everything that talks to a terminal emulation library sits behind
//! [`TerminalBackend`]. The trait only deals in `phantom_core::types`, which
//! are the same types the daemon puts on the wire — so the engine, the
//! protocol and the CLI stay independent of which emulator is compiled in.
//!
//! Exactly one backend is selected at compile time via cargo features and
//! exposed as [`DefaultBackend`].
